VitParticleFilterTracker
VitParticleFilterTracker is a cutting-edge project that integrates the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a Particle Filter to achieve precise object position tracking. By combining the strengths of both technologies, this system is designed to provide robust and reliable tracking even in dynamic and complex environments.

Features
Vision Transformer (ViT): Leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for superior feature extraction and object recognition.
Particle Filter: Utilizes probabilistic algorithms for accurate state estimation and object tracking.
Robust Tracking: Capable of handling challenging scenarios with high accuracy.
Modular Design: Easy to extend and integrate with other projects or frameworks.
Installation
To install and run VitParticleFilterTracker, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VitParticleFilterTracker.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd VitParticleFilterTracker
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
To use VitParticleFilterTracker, provide the input data (e.g., video feed or images) and configure the tracking parameters in the config.yaml file. The system will output the tracked positions of the objects in real-time.

Examples
Here are some example use cases:

Needle Tracking: In medical procedures, the system can track the position of a needle during insertion.
Object Tracking in Robotics: Monitor and track the position of tools or objects in a robotic environment.
Surveillance: Track moving objects in a surveillance feed.
